### Greetings, netizen. ü§ì

**I am Robson, but I like to go by DiskTurbo online.** I am a student of computers üñ•Ô∏è; both the software and hardware aspects. This account is a display of my creations over the last couple of years, mostly some projects I created during my schooling. I also release some projects I just want people to have fun with.

Mainly been focusing on game development for the last couple of years but I have a passion for all forms of computer programming, especially when it comes to how it can apply to emergent technologies like AR and VR.

I've used multiple languages over the years like C#, C++, Python, Java, and more; and that list will continue to grow for as long as I live.

***Enjoy what's avaliable and I hope you look out for my future work!***
