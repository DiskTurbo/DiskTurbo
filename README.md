### Greetings, netizen. ü§ì

**I am Robson, but I like to go by DiskTurbo online.** I am a student of computers üñ•Ô∏è; both the software and hardware aspects. This account is a display of my creations over the last couple of years, mostly some projects I created during my schooling. I also release some projects I just want people to have fun with.

I've got years of programming experience, including languages such as:

- C++

- C#

- Java

- Python

- HTML/CSS

- Javascript

And that list will continue to grow for as long as I live.

***Enjoy what's avaliable and I hope you look out for my future work!***
